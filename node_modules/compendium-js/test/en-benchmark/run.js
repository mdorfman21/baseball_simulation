Run PoS test against penn treebank

JSON file took from nlp_compromise (thanks a bunch!).

It's good to note that some of the Penn Treebank dataset sentences are not perfectly tagged, so measure
of deviation from Penn Treebank is quite subjective, as Compendium may be good where Penn is wrong
(in a VERY LITTLE proportion.. 0.1 to 0.3% probably on used test set). Examples of Penn errors:

- Too much money is at stake for program traders to give up. - give/VB up/IN where it should be give/VB up/RP
- Currently, ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding. Currently/NNP where it should be Currently/RB
- ...to the Cray-3 development which... Cray-3/CD where it should be Cray-3/

I still don't know where these errors (if it's proved they are) come from, as I don't have access to raw
original version of the dataset.

        > makes sense but interesting: new brill rules provided a great improvement in minimal
        mode but a slight decline in full mode - this is the limit of rules over a lexicon

- April 17th, 1959 sentences:
    Minimal:    90.65% exact tags, 352 exact sentences, 0.72ms av. per sentence
    Full:       92.74% exact tags, 518 exact sentences, 0.36ms av. per sentence

        > would be worth the check why the full mode is a lot more fast - instinct says because
        likely initial lexicon search is successful, so it doesn't search for variations. Trie
        lexicon will probably make both modes faster.

- April 19th, 1947 sentences:
    Minimal:    90.68% exact tags, 355 exact sentences, 0.75ms av. per sentence
    Full:       93.14% exact tags, 565 exact sentences, 0.36ms av. per sentence

        > Lexer improvements made an appreciable difference in full mode: +0.4%.

- April 19th:
    Minimal:    91.74% exact tags, 434/1949 exact sentences, 1.04ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.35% exact tags, 562/1523 exact sentences, 0.83ms av. per sentence

        > Whole set of new rules and vocabulary in compendium, more granularity on existing
        rules (verbs inference, less suffixes...)
        > Lighter embedded lexicons in both modes

- April 23th:
    Minimal:    91.77% exact tags, 435/1949 exact sentences, 1.38ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.37% exact tags, 564/1523 exact sentences, 1.15ms av. per sentence

- April 29th:
    Minimal:    91.58% exact tags, 431/1949 exact sentences, 1.96ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.13% exact tags, 551/1523 exact sentences, 1.57ms av. per sentence

        > Slight decrease for the last week, but on the other hand, Compendium gained a lot
        of features (verbs inflection, synonyms...). Will regain a lot on next round of
        new rules

- May 8th:
    Minimal:    92.32% exact tags, 480/1949 exact sentences, 1.90ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.37% exact tags, 772/1546 exact sentences, 1.57ms av. per sentence

        > New increase! A 0.80% gain in minimal mode, only by using simpler inferences
        on composed words. Almost no change in full mode.

- May 10th:
    Minimal:    92.52% exact tags, 506/1949 exact sentences, 1.79ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.58% exact tags, 611/1546 exact sentences, 2.58ms av. per sentence

        > Ok, contrasted results after insertion of irregular verbs. First a decrease to 91%,
        then has been hard to reach again the previous score - lot of new rules to solve
        newly found issues.

        The decrease following addition of verbs was due to the fact that new automated verbs
        inflections to populate the lexicon replaced some original lexicon terms, whose
        statistical tag was not a verb-related one, but rather noun or adjective. Here is again
        a limit of rule-based processors versus machine learning based one.

- May 16th:
    Minimal:    92.36% exact tags, 499/1949 exact sentences, 1.90ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.37% exact tags, 586/1546 exact sentences, 2.02ms av. per sentence

    > Yet another slight decrease, due to support of lot of new features in v0.0.11

- May 17th:
    Minimal:    92.53% exact tags, 477/1822 exact sentences, 2.10ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.39% exact tags, 584/1546 exact sentences, 2.05ms av. per sentence

    > A slight increase thanks to new rules.

- May 17th:
    Minimal:    92.40% exact tags, 497/1978 exact sentences, 2.08ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.22% exact tags, 676/1914 exact sentences, 1.99ms av. per sentence

    > Slight decrease but good news! Finally found why so much varying penn test sentences
    available: due to the way emoticons regexps were applied. Seems liked lexer fix in
    commit #0e8091 solved the issue, and now a lot more sentences are available for tests,
    in particular in full mode.

- May 29th:
    Minimal:    92.54% exact tags, 597/2455 exact sentences, 2.10ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.55% exact tags, 852/2370 exact sentences, 2.39ms av. per sentence

    > Last rounds of improvements were not focused at all on PoS tagging, however
    new rules introduced for other purpose led to a slight improvement in
    PoS tagging stats.

- July 12th:
    Minimal:    92.57% exact tags, 600/2455 exact sentences, 2.92ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.56% exact tags, 852/2370 exact sentences, 3.33ms av. per sentence

    > Regular check before multichar reduction, roman numerals.

- July 13th:
    Minimal:    92.72% exact tags, 618/2480 exact sentences, 2.99ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.54% exact tags, 856/2394 exact sentences, 3.11ms av. per sentence

    > Multiple char reduction ("gooooood" to "good" or "noooooo" to "no"), roman numerals,
    improved NER, new Brill's rules for "have" and "like" edge cases.

- September 4:
    Minimal:    92.69% exact tags, 626/2481 exact sentences, 1.73ms av. per sentence
    Full:       94.29% exact tags, 846/2478 exact sentences, 2.00ms av. per sentence

    > By running PoS tests on full mode, a lot of tests were failing. As it is important
    to be more compliant to strict tests than to the Penn Treebank (that is only an
    indicator), the issues have been fixed for the unit tests, leading to a decrease
    of the performance in full mode: -0.25% and -0.03% in minimal mode.
